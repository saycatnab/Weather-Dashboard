# Weather-Dashboard
Creating a weather application with a 5-day forecast, incl. wind, temperature and humidity for any city

# Description

I have been given a starter code with a html file with the necessary elements.
Using the starter code, I have used javascript and jQuery logic to do the following:

- Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.

- When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.

- When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:

    The city name

    The date

    An icon representation of weather conditions

    The temperature

    The humidity

    The wind speed

- When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:

    The date

    An icon representation of weather conditions

    The temperature

    The humidity

- When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
